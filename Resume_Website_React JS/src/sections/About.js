            <p>I started my journey in the world of computers from an young age,
            now I’m 20 years old, Pursuing my Software Engineering Degree in
            VIT University Vellore.  Web development is my center of interest, i always
            love the idea of cross-platform development, 1-n one code base deploy into almost
            any platform, which web technology like Javascript enables me to do. I also like
            creating Interactive UI components for better UX  and share those desgin and codes
            to the world through Github, Codepen and Instagram.
